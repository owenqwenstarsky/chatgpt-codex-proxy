# Translation Behavior

This document describes how `chatgpt-codex-proxy` translates between its OpenAI-compatible public API and the private ChatGPT Codex backend it actually talks to.

It is based on the current implementation, not an external specification. The code paths that define this behavior live primarily in:

- `internal/server/public.go`
- `internal/server/compact.go`
- `internal/server/images.go`
- `internal/server/session.go`
- `internal/openai/request.go`
- `internal/openai/schema.go`
- `internal/openai/tuple.go`
- `internal/turn/normalized.go`
- `internal/turn/accumulator.go`
- `internal/codex/http_client.go`
- `internal/turn/request.go`
- `internal/codex/ws_client.go`
- `internal/openai/types.go`

## Overview

The proxy keeps one shared streaming translation stack for Chat Completions and Responses, a dedicated compact path for `/v1/responses/compact`, and a direct-first Images API adapter with a Responses tool fallback.

The high-level streaming pipeline is:

1. Accept OpenAI-compatible JSON on `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/responses`.
2. Normalize that payload into one internal Codex-style request model.
3. Resolve continuation state and account affinity.
4. Send the normalized request to the Codex backend over HTTP SSE or WebSocket.
5. Rebuild either OpenAI Chat Completions output or OpenAI Responses output from the upstream event stream.

The compact pipeline is:

1. Accept OpenAI-compatible JSON on `/v1/responses/compact`.
2. Normalize that payload into `turn.NormalizedCompactRequest`, which embeds `turn.CompactRequest`.
3. If `previous_response_id` is present, expand saved continuation history locally.
4. Append a compaction trigger and consume the upstream Responses stream.
5. Return the encrypted context in an OpenAI-style `response.compaction` object.

The image pipeline is:

1. Accept JSON on `/v1/images/generations`, or JSON/multipart input on `/v1/images/edits`.
2. Default the image model to `gpt-image-2`; convert multipart edit uploads to data-URL JSON references.
3. Send the request to `/codex/images/generations` or `/codex/images/edits` and pass the native JSON or SSE response through unchanged.
4. If the native endpoint returns `404`, `405`, or `501`, build the previous forced `image_generation` tool request and send it through the Responses transport.
5. On fallback only, translate the returned `image_generation_call` into Images API JSON or SSE events.

## Canonical Internal Request

The canonical streaming request is `turn.Request` plus protocol-neutral metadata in `turn.NormalizedRequest`.

The Codex request fields used by the proxy are:

- `model`
- `instructions`
- `input`
- `stream`
- `store`
- `tools`
- `tool_choice`
- `text`
- `reasoning`
- `service_tier`
- `previous_response_id`
- `prompt_cache_key`
- `include`

The translation-only fields are:

- `ModelExplicit`
- `TupleSchema`

The canonical compact request is `turn.CompactRequest` plus protocol-neutral metadata in `turn.NormalizedCompactRequest`.

The Codex compact fields used by the proxy are:

- `model`
- `instructions`
- `input`
- `text`
- `reasoning`

The compact translation-only fields are:

- `ModelExplicit`
- `PreviousResponseID`
- `TupleSchema`

## Endpoint Entry Behavior

### `/v1/chat/completions`

`POST /v1/chat/completions` first reads the raw body and then chooses one of two parsers:

- If `messages` is present and non-empty, it is treated as a Chat Completions request.
- Otherwise, if the body has Responses-style fields like `input`, `instructions`, `previous_response_id`, `text`, or `reasoning`, it is accepted as a compatibility path and parsed as a Responses request.
- If neither shape has meaningful content, the proxy returns `400` with `request body must include chat messages or responses input`.

When the compatibility path is used, the request is normalized with `openai.Responses(...)`; the `/v1/chat/completions` handler still selects Chat Completions response shaping.

If both `messages` and Responses-style fields are present, `messages` wins.

### `/v1/responses`

`POST /v1/responses` binds directly to `openai.ResponsesRequest` and normalizes with `openai.Responses(...)`.

Codex remote compaction v2 also uses this endpoint. Its request includes the existing conversation followed by a payload-free `{"type":"compaction_trigger"}` input item. The proxy preserves that trigger on the upstream Responses stream and relays the resulting encrypted `compaction` output events to the client.

`GET /v1/responses` upgrades to a persistent WebSocket connection. The client sends one JSON `response.create` event per turn. WebSocket streaming is implicit, so a supplied `stream` field is ignored. `background: true` is rejected, while an optional `generate` boolean is forwarded only on the upstream WebSocket payload.

The connection processes turns sequentially. It reuses the same upstream WebSocket while the selected account remains the same; if account selection changes, it closes that upstream connection and opens another one. Each turn ends with `response.completed` or an `error` JSON message. There is no SSE `done` event or `[DONE]` sentinel.

Malformed JSON, unsupported event types, and other request-level protocol errors are returned as `type: "error"` messages without intentionally closing the client connection. An unknown `previous_response_id` uses the WebSocket-specific code `previous_response_not_found`.

### `/v1/responses/compact`

`POST /v1/responses/compact` binds directly to `openai.ResponsesCompactRequest` and normalizes with `openai.Compact(...)`.

The public endpoint returns non-streaming JSON. Internally, it uses the Responses SSE transport and collects encrypted compaction state before returning. Pass the returned `output` into the next `/v1/responses` request, followed by the new user message.

### `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits`

Both endpoints use the native Codex Images API first. The public image model defaults to `gpt-image-2`; `gpt-image-1.5` is also accepted. JSON fields are preserved, while multipart edit uploads are converted into JSON `images` and `mask` references containing data URLs.

The direct adapter forwards image fields including:

- `n`
- `size`
- `quality`
- `background`
- `output_format`
- `moderation`
- `output_compression`
- `partial_images`
- `input_fidelity` on edits

JSON edits accept `images` entries containing `image_url` or `file_id`, plus an optional `mask`. Multipart edits accept one or more `image` or `image[]` files and an optional `mask` file; uploads are encoded as data URLs before being sent upstream.

Native non-streaming responses and their metadata are returned unchanged. Native SSE responses are forwarded and flushed as they arrive. When streaming is requested but upstream returns JSON, the proxy converts each image into a completed SSE event and preserves its metadata.

If a native endpoint responds with `404`, `405`, or `501`, the request falls back to an enclosing Responses request using a forced `image_generation` tool. Other upstream errors are returned directly and do not trigger fallback.

On fallback, the adapter forwards the same tool options except `n`; the image tool produces one image. `response_format: "url"` becomes a data URL because the tool returns image bytes instead of a hosted URL.

Image options are passed through, not simulated locally. Live direct-endpoint testing confirmed native image usage metadata and also returned an output size different from the requested size, so clients should use the returned metadata.

## Model Resolution

Model normalization does not rewrite user-supplied model IDs.

The bootstrap catalog includes `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`,
`gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.5`, and `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`. Astra and Sol advertise a
`low` default reasoning level; the proxy's default model is Astra. Astra
accepts the Codex effort levels `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and
`ultra`.

Model discovery records access per account, including accounts on the same plan.
Model limits and reasoning metadata from upstream are cached and returned to Codex
clients requesting `/v1/models?client_version=...`. The bundled Astra context
limits are 272,000 by default and 872,000 maximum; these are Codex client limits,
not the public API's advertised context size.

- If a model is explicitly supplied, it must exist in the current model catalog.
- If no model is supplied, normalization leaves it empty.
- Later, during account acquisition, the proxy chooses a route-valid default model for the selected account.

Reasoning effort on Chat Completions is converted to:

- `reasoning.effort = <value>`
- `reasoning.summary = "auto"`

Reasoning on Responses uses the request's explicit reasoning object. If `effort` is set and `summary` is empty, `summary` is forced to `"auto"`.

Whenever reasoning is enabled, the proxy also sends:

- `include = ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]`

## Request Translation Rules

### Instructions

The proxy collapses instruction-like content into a single leading Codex `developer` input item, and leaves the top-level `instructions` field empty. The Codex backend reserves `instructions` for its own baseline prompt, so client-supplied instructions are sent as a `developer` turn at the front of `input` instead.

- Chat Completions `system` and `developer` messages are flattened as text and joined with `\n\n`.
- Responses `instructions` is included first if present.
- Responses input items with `role = system` or `role = developer` and no explicit `type` are also collapsed into the same developer item.
- The collapsed text becomes one `developer` input item placed before all other input. If no instruction text is present, no developer item is added and `instructions` is sent as an empty string.

Only text-like content is allowed in lifted instruction roles. Image content is rejected with `400`.

### Message and Input Content

OpenAI content parts are normalized into Codex content parts as follows:

- `text`, `input_text`, empty type -> `input_text`
- `output_text` -> `output_text`
- `reasoning_text` -> `reasoning_text`
- `image_url`, `input_image` -> `input_image`
- `file`, `input_file` -> `input_file`

`input_file` must include at least one of:

- `file_data`
- `file_url`
- `file_id`

Chat-style `file` parts may put those fields under a nested `file` object. Audio input is rejected locally because the current Codex upstream rejects both `input_audio` and audio MIME types supplied as files.

Unsupported content parts return `400` with an `unsupported_content_part` error message.

### Chat Completions Message Mapping

Chat Completions messages are converted like this:

- `user` and `assistant` messages without tool calls become Codex `InputItem{Role, Content}`.
- `assistant` or `user` messages with `tool_calls` first emit the role/content item if content exists, then emit one input item per tool call.
- Legacy assistant `function_call` becomes `InputItem{Type: "function_call", Name, Arguments}`.
- `tool` messages become tool output items. Text-only output remains a string; output containing images or files is preserved as structured content.

Tool outputs are typed using the earlier tool-call type seen in the same request:

- function tool -> `function_call_output`
- custom tool -> `custom_tool_call_output`

If the original call type is not known, tool output defaults to `function_call_output`.

If a Chat Completions request has no input messages after normalization, the proxy inserts one empty user text item.

### Responses Input Mapping

Responses input is converted like this:

- String input becomes a single user `input_text` item.
- Generic role/content items become `InputItem{Role, Content}`.
- Missing role on a generic item defaults to `user`.
- `function_call` maps to Codex `function_call`.
- `custom_tool_call` maps to Codex `custom_tool_call`.
- `function_call_output` and `custom_tool_call_output` preserve either `output` text or structured `output` content.
- `reasoning` items preserve:
  - `id`
  - `status`
  - `content`
  - `summary`
  - `encrypted_content`
- `compaction` items preserve:
  - `id`
  - `encrypted_content`
- `compaction_trigger` is preserved as a payload-free item for streamed Codex remote compaction.
- Generic role/content items preserve `phase` when present so assistant output messages can be replayed through compaction.

### Tool Definitions

Tool definitions are normalized into Codex tools like this:

- `function` tools are rewritten into top-level `{type, name, description, parameters, strict}` objects even if they arrived in nested Chat Completions form.
- Function tool schemas are run through `NormalizeSchema`, which ensures `type = object` schemas have a `properties` map.
- `web_search_preview` is rewritten to `web_search`.
- `web_search` stays `web_search`.
- Custom tools and unknown tool types are passed through as-is.
- Tool names longer than 64 characters are shortened deterministically before the upstream request and restored in Chat Completions and Responses output. Colliding shortened names receive numeric suffixes.

Legacy Chat Completions `functions` are converted into modern `tools` only when `tools` is empty.

### Tool Choice

Tool choice is normalized like this:

- JSON string `"auto"` or `"none"` passes through as a JSON string.
- `{type: "function", name: ...}` becomes `{"type":"function","name":"..."}`.
- `{type: "function", function: {name: ...}}` is collapsed to the same form.
- `{type: "web_search"}` and `{type: "web_search_preview"}` become `{"type":"web_search"}`.
- Unrecognized objects pass through unchanged.

Legacy Chat Completions `function_call` is converted to:

- `"auto"` or `"none"` as a JSON string
- `{"type":"function","name":"..."}` when a specific name is provided

Modern `tools` and `tool_choice` take precedence over legacy `functions` and `function_call`.

### Structured Output Translation

Chat Completions `response_format` and Responses `text.format` are normalized into Codex `text.format`.

Supported modes:

- text: omitted upstream
- `json_object`
- `json_schema`

For `json_schema`, the proxy performs two schema adjustments before sending it upstream:

1. It injects `additionalProperties: false` on object schemas when missing.
2. If the schema uses tuple validation via `prefixItems`, it converts those tuple nodes into object-shaped schemas keyed by `"0"`, `"1"`, and so on.

When tuple conversion happens, the original schema is retained in `NormalizedRequest.TupleSchema` so response payloads can be converted back to array form before returning to the client.

## Fields Accepted but Ignored

The proxy accepts several OpenAI fields for compatibility but does not apply them upstream.

Chat Completions ignored fields:

- `n`
- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `max_tokens`
- `presence_penalty`
- `frequency_penalty`
- `stop`
- `user`
- `parallel_tool_calls`
- `stream_options`

Responses ignored fields:

- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `max_output_tokens`
- `parallel_tool_calls`
- `store`
- `background` on `POST /v1/responses`; the WebSocket endpoint rejects `background: true`
- `user`
- `metadata`
- `stream_options`

`service_tier` is retained on the canonical request and sent on both HTTP and WebSocket Codex paths. OpenAI's `auto` value is normalized to Codex's `default` wire value, and the compatibility alias `fast` is normalized to `priority`.

The Chat Completions, Responses, and Responses compact JSON handlers decode `Content-Encoding: zstd` request bodies. Identity or an omitted encoding is accepted; other request content encodings are rejected locally.

## Continuation Translation

Continuation resolution happens after request normalization.

### Explicit continuation

If `previous_response_id` is supplied:

- The proxy looks it up in its in-memory continuation store.
- If the ID is unknown or expired, it returns `400` with code `invalid_previous_response_id`.
- If the request did not specify a model, the model is filled from the saved continuation record.
- The saved conversation key becomes `prompt_cache_key`.
- The saved account ID becomes the preferred account.
- The saved upstream turn state becomes `x-codex-turn-state`.

### Explicit continuation for compaction

`/v1/responses/compact` expands `previous_response_id` into a complete context window before compaction.

If `previous_response_id` is supplied on the compact endpoint:

- The proxy looks it up in the same in-memory continuation store.
- If the ID is unknown or expired, it returns `400` with code `invalid_previous_response_id`.
- If the compact request did not specify a model, the model is filled from the saved continuation record.
- Saved continuation history is converted back into Codex input items and prepended to the current compact request input.
- `previous_response_id` is not sent upstream.

The compact endpoint does not perform implicit continuation detection.

### Implicit continuation

If there is no explicit `previous_response_id`, the proxy may opportunistically convert a replay-style request into a continuation request.

That only happens when:

- the normalized request has a model
- a stable conversation key can be derived
- a recent continuation exists for that conversation key
- the saved model matches
- the saved instructions match
- the new input contains prior assistant or tool history
- the prefix of the new input exactly matches the saved prior input history
- any replayed tool outputs in the trimmed suffix reference known prior `call_id` values

If all checks pass:

- the already-known prefix is removed from `input`
- `previous_response_id` is filled with the saved response ID
- the preferred account and turn state are restored
- the model is pinned to the saved model

If the later WebSocket continuation attempt fails for an implicit resume, the proxy falls back to the original full request over HTTP.

### Prompt cache key derivation

When possible, the proxy derives a stable `prompt_cache_key` from:

- model
- normalized instructions
- the conversation prefix of the normalized input

The conversation prefix stops at the last assistant or tool-call item. Explicit client values are preserved; this derivation is used only when `prompt_cache_key` is omitted.

## Upstream Transport Translation

Chat Completions and Responses requests consume an upstream stream even when the public request is non-streaming. Native Images requests use the matching JSON or SSE mode. Responses compact also consumes an upstream stream and returns a JSON compaction object.

### HTTP path

For requests without continuation state or hosted web search, the proxy sends `codex.StreamRequestPayload(req)` to `POST /codex/responses`. JSON HTTP requests with explicit continuation state expand the locally saved transcript and use the same path without forwarding `previous_response_id`.

That forced HTTP payload does all of the following:

- `stream = true`
- `store = false`
- `previous_response_id = ""`

So even if the public request was non-streaming, the proxy still uses the streaming Codex endpoint and reconstructs the final JSON object locally.

### WebSocket path

The proxy uses `WSS /codex/responses` for implicit continuations, requests containing the hosted `web_search` tool, and turns received through the public Responses WebSocket. It sends:

- `type = "response.create"`
- `model`
- `input`
- `instructions`
- optional `tools`
- optional `tool_choice`
- optional `text`
- optional `reasoning`
- optional `previous_response_id`
- optional `prompt_cache_key`
- optional `include`
- optional `generate` for public WebSocket turns

The WebSocket payload omits `stream` and `store`; it forwards `service_tier` when supplied. A persistent public WebSocket session can send later `response.create` or `response.append` turns over the same upstream connection when the account does not change. Downstream append turns are normalized to upstream `response.create` payloads with `previous_response_id` and incremental input.

## Upstream Events the Proxy Consumes

The proxy uses a single accumulator to interpret upstream events.

It tracks:

- response ID
- model
- final status
- text deltas and final text
- reasoning summary deltas
- tool calls
- output item ordering
- usage
- final raw response payload

Internal quota events are consumed but not forwarded:

- `codex.rate_limits` updates cached account quota state

## Non-Streaming Response Translation

For `stream = false`, the proxy still reads the full upstream stream and waits for `response.completed`.

If the stream ends before a completed response is seen, it returns an upstream error.

### Chat Completions object

The rebuilt Chat Completions response has:

- `id`
- `object = "chat.completion"`
- `created`, copied from upstream `created_at` when available or synthesized locally
- `model`
- `choices[0].index = 0`
- `choices[0].message.role = "assistant"`
- `choices[0].message.content = accumulated text`
- optional `choices[0].message.reasoning_content`
- optional `choices[0].message.tool_calls`
- optional `choices[0].message.images` containing generated image data URLs
- `choices[0].finish_reason = "tool_calls"` when tool calls exist, else `"stop"`
- `usage` rewritten into Chat Completions token field names

Tool calls are returned in native shape:

- function tools -> `{type:"function", function:{name, arguments}}`
- custom tools -> `{type:"custom", custom:{name, input}}`

### Responses object

The rebuilt Responses response has:

- `id`
- `object = "response"`
- `model`
- `status`
- `output`
- `output_text`
- `usage`

The proxy starts from the native final upstream `response` object, preserving other top-level and usage fields it does not explicitly rebuild. It then overwrites or fills the compatibility fields listed above.

`output` is reconstructed from both:

- explicit upstream output items
- tool call state accumulated from tool-related events

If the final output has no items at all, the proxy synthesizes one completed assistant message item containing `output_text`.

### Usage mapping

Codex usage is translated like this:

- Chat Completions:
  - `input_tokens` -> `prompt_tokens`
  - `output_tokens` -> `completion_tokens`
- Responses:
  - `input_tokens` -> `input_tokens`
  - `output_tokens` -> `output_tokens`
- Both:
  - `total_tokens = input + output`
  - cached token detail becomes `cached_tokens`
  - reasoning token detail becomes `reasoning_tokens`

### Tuple-schema reconversion

If a tuple schema was rewritten on the way upstream:

- non-streaming Chat Completions patches `message.content`
- non-streaming Responses patches both `output_text` and the structured `output`

The reconversion rewrites object-shaped `"0"`, `"1"` tuple placeholders back into arrays using the original schema captured at request time.

### Compact response shaping

The proxy collects the encrypted compaction item from the stream and returns:

- `id` and `created_at` from upstream response metadata
- `object = "response.compaction"`
- `output` containing the encrypted context for the next request
- `usage` when present upstream

A successful compaction requires a completed stream and exactly one compaction item with non-empty `encrypted_content`. Truncated, failed, and incomplete streams return errors. The final event may have an empty `output` array; the proxy collects the compaction item from the item completion event.

If tuple-schema reconversion is active, the proxy applies the same output-message reconversion used by `/v1/responses` before returning the compacted object.

## Streaming Response Translation

### Chat Completions streaming

The proxy emits Chat Completions SSE, not raw Codex SSE.

It always starts by sending an initial assistant-role chunk:

- `delta = {"role":"assistant"}`

Every chunk includes one stable `created` timestamp for the stream.

Then it maps upstream events like this:

- `response.output_text.delta` -> `delta.content`
- `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` -> `delta.reasoning_content`
- image-generation partial or completed output -> `delta.images`

Tool-call streaming has a compatibility shim:

- Upstream function tools and custom tools are both emitted as Chat Completions `tool_calls` function-shaped deltas.
- The initial delta for a tool call includes:
  - `index`
  - `id`
  - `type = "function"`
  - `function.name`
  - empty `function.arguments`
- Subsequent deltas append argument text.
- For custom tools, the streamed argument text is actually the Codex custom tool `input`.

This is intentionally asymmetric:

- streamed Chat Completions custom tools are exposed as function-shaped deltas for client compatibility
- non-streaming Chat Completions still preserve native custom tool shape
- replayed function-shaped custom tool calls are mapped back upstream as custom tools when the tool name matches a declared custom tool

At completion:

- if tuple-schema reconversion is active, the buffered JSON text is converted back and emitted as one final content delta
- a final chunk is sent with finish reason and usage
- then `data: [DONE]`

### Responses streaming

The proxy emits Responses-style SSE events and preserves most upstream event types.

For ordinary non-tool events:

- the SSE event name is the upstream `type`
- the payload is the upstream raw event body

There are three important modifications.

First, tool call events can be synthesized or normalized:

- `response.function_call_arguments.delta`
- `response.function_call_arguments.done`
- `response.custom_tool_call_input.delta`
- `response.custom_tool_call_input.done`
- `response.output_item.added`
- `response.output_item.done`

The accumulator may emit missing `output_item.added` and `output_item.done` events so the downstream Responses stream contains a coherent tool-call output sequence even when Codex provides fragmented data.

Second, on `response.completed`, the proxy rewrites the nested `response` object so it has:

- rebuilt `output`
- filled `output_text` if missing
- filled `status = completed` if missing
- filled `id` if missing
- filled `model` if missing
- rebuilt `usage`

Third, if tuple-schema reconversion is active:

- buffered `response.output_text.delta` text is reconverted at completion
- one synthetic `response.output_text.delta` SSE is emitted with the patched JSON text
- the final `response.completed` payload is also patched

The Responses stream ends after `response.completed`; it does not append a Chat Completions-style `[DONE]` sentinel.

The public Responses WebSocket applies the same tool-event normalization, completed-response rebuilding, and tuple reconversion, but writes plain JSON WebSocket messages. It does not append the SSE terminal event or `[DONE]` sentinel.

## Error Translation

Request-shape and normalization failures are returned as OpenAI-style JSON errors.

Model lookup failures return:

- HTTP `404`
- code `model_not_found`

Unknown or expired continuation IDs on the JSON HTTP endpoints return:

- HTTP `400`
- code `invalid_previous_response_id`

On the public Responses WebSocket, the equivalent error message has status `400` and code `previous_response_not_found`.

Upstream failures are classified into OpenAI-style proxy errors:

- upstream `401` or auth-like error code -> `401`, `upstream_unauthorized`
- upstream `403` -> `403`, `upstream_error`; generic access denials temporarily cool down the account
- upstream `402` or quota-like error code -> `402`, `quota_exhausted`
- upstream `429` or rate-limit-like error code -> `429`, `rate_limited`
- other upstream failures -> clamped upstream status, `upstream_error`

During streaming, classified errors are sent as SSE error payloads instead of raw upstream error objects. Responses streams use top-level `{type, code, message, sequence_number}` error events; Chat and legacy Completions retain the OpenAI error wrapper.

For requests without explicit continuation state, retryable upstream failures (`401`, `402`, `403`, `408`, `429`, and transient `5xx` statuses) fail over to another eligible account before client-visible output begins. Each account is attempted at most once per recovery pass. When 402/429 exhausts all model-compatible capacity, the proxy waits for the earliest typed cooldown or quota-reset deadline for up to `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_WAIT` (default `2m`) and then refreshes selection. A wait-budget expiry is a 429 with `Retry-After`; permanently unusable capacity remains a 503. Explicit `previous_response_id` continuations wait and retry their original account instead of migrating. Non-streaming responses remain retryable until the full upstream response has been buffered; streaming responses stop being retryable after the first public event is ready for delivery.

If the upstream rejects replayed reasoning state with an invalid-signature error (`thinking_signature_invalid` or `invalid_encrypted_content`), the proxy drops the `reasoning` input items that carry `encrypted_content` and retries the request once on the same account before client-visible output begins. This applies to the Chat Completions and Responses paths as well as Anthropic Messages, so a replayed transcript whose encrypted reasoning was produced by a different account (for example after account rotation) recovers transparently instead of surfacing the error.

## State Recorded From Responses

After a successful completed upstream response, the proxy stores a continuation record containing:

- response ID
- selected account ID
- turn state from `x-codex-turn-state`
- derived conversation key
- normalized instructions
- resolved model
- full replayable input history
- tool call IDs seen in the response

That saved state is what powers both explicit and implicit continuation translation on later requests.

## Practical Summary

The proxy is not a thin field rename layer. It does all of the following:

- normalizes two public OpenAI request formats into one private Codex request format
- collapses instructions and content into the shapes Codex accepts
- rewrites schemas for Codex compatibility and converts tuple outputs back afterward
- converts public replay-style follow-up turns into true Codex continuations when safe
- uses HTTP SSE for ordinary requests and WebSocket for continuations, hosted web search, and the public Responses WebSocket
- reconstructs OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses outputs from the Codex stream
- hides internal quota events and translates upstream failures into OpenAI-style errors

If this behavior changes in code, this document should be updated to stay authoritative.
